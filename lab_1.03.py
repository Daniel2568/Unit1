Part 1 - Printing Practice
Practice typing out some statements in the editor part of the IDE, then hit "Run" at the top of the screen:
**Remember you must exit() python interpreter before running a script!!!

    Expression                                      Expected Output                               Did anything unexpected happen?

b)  print(1)                                         stynx error/ command does'nt exist           Yes, It printed it
c)  print(1 + 2)                                     stynx error/ command doesn't exist           Yes, it printed 3
d)  print("1" + "2")                                 1+2                                          Kind of, it printed 12
e)  print("this" + " " + "is" + " " +                this is a sentence.                          No
    "a" + " " +                                      
    "sentence" + ".")                                

Part 2 - Variables Practice
1. In your Console
Type and run the following:
    animal = "dogs"
    print(animal + " are really cool.")
In your Notebook
Respond to the following:
    1. What happens?  The interpreter prints "dogs are really cool"
    2. How would you make the program print out "cats are really cool" instead? No, Dogs are better because they actually do something.

2. In your Console
Type and run the following code:
print(dogs + " are cool.")
In your Notebook
Respond to the following questions:
    1. What output does this produce? It said that 'dog' is not defined 
    2. Why does this happen?  Because we never set a variable for 'dog' and 'dog' wasn't in quotes
